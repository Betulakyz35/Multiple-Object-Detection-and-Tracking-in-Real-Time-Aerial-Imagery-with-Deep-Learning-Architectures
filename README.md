# Multiple-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-in-Real-Time-Aerial-Imagery-with-Deep-Learning-Architectures
This project is a final project carried out by students of the Computer Engineering Department at Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University. The project also participates in the TÜBİTAK 2209-A University Students Research Projects Support Programme and the SAYZEK-ATP programme.
The aim of the project is to develop a high-accuracy and diversified system based on aerial images for real-time object detection and tracking in autonomous vehicles.
In this context, the VisDrone and DOTA-v1.5 datasets were combined to increase the diversity of aerial images. The obtained dataset was trained with both the YOLOv11 and Faster R-CNN models. 
Object detection was performed using the weight files obtained as a result of the training, and then multi-object tracking was applied using these detections.
The developed system aims to provide a real-time, efficient, and accurate object detection and tracking infrastructure for autonomous systems, especially in low-altitude aerial images.
